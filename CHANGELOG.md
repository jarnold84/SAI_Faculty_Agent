## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Planning for Phase 1 completion: more golden fixtures, email enrichment, success rate evaluation

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-15 - Working Foundation

### Added
- Complete FastAPI server with `/scrape` endpoint working locally and deployed
- Stable JSON response schema (`NormalizedLead`/`ScrapeResponse`) with Pydantic validation
- Core analyzer for basic strategy selection (`analyze/plan.py`)
- HTTP fetcher with retries and timeout (`fetch/http.py`)
- JSON-LD Person extraction strategy (`extract/strategies/json_ld.py`)
- Directory table parsing strategy (`extract/strategies/directory_table.py`)
- First golden fixture: Fresno State Music Faculty directory (36 faculty members)
- Pytest test framework with smoke tests and golden fixture tests
- Basic email normalization and status tracking
- Deployment configuration fixed for Replit

### Fixed
- Deployment configuration: switched from `python3 main.py` to `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`
- Port binding for external accessibility on deployed endpoint

### Testing
- Golden fixture test passing: `test_fresno_music_golden_fixture()`
- Smoke tests passing for all core endpoints
- Local and deployed health checks working
- Success rate: 100% on our test fixture (36/36 faculty extracted)

### Architecture Decisions
- Strategy pattern implementation working with fallback chain
- Feature flags structure in place for future expensive operations
- Golden fixtures approach preventing regressions
- Timeboxed development approach successful

## [0.0.1] - 2024-01-15 - Initial Setup

### Added
- Project structure planning
- Visual architecture maps with Mermaid diagrams
- Component specifications and contracts
- Build checklist and phase planning
- Testing strategy with fixtures approach
- Replit project structure with all required folders
- Basic Flask app placeholder

### Documentation
- `docs/overview.md` - Complete system architecture
- `docs/progress.md` - Daily progress tracking
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

### Architecture Decisions
- Strategy pattern for extraction methods
- Feature flags for expensive operations
- Golden fixtures for regression prevention
- Timeboxed development to avoid loops

### Next Steps
- Install project dependencies (FastAPI, BeautifulSoup, Pydantic, Playwright)
- Create Pydantic schemas for data validation
- Build `/scrape` endpoint in `api/server.py`
- Set up pytest test framework
- Begin URL analyzer implementation

- **Items**: 36 faculty members extracted
- **Test**: `test_golden_fixtures.py::test_fresno_music_golden_fixture`
- **Must Not Break**: Names, titles, profile URLs all present; email status tracking working
- **API Status**: âœ… Working locally and deployed on Replit
