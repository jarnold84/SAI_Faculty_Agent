## 🏗️ Component Status

### Core Components
- [✅] **API Server** (`api/server.py`) - Complete FastAPI endpoint working locally + deployed
- [✅] **Analyzer** (`analyze/plan.py`) - Basic URL pattern recognition working
- [✅] **HTTP Fetcher** (`fetch/http.py`) - HTTP requests with retries and timeout
- [✅] **Schema Validator** (`schemas/`) - Complete Pydantic models for all data types
- [✅] **Normalizer** (`normalize/normalize.py`) - Basic data cleaning and email status tracking

### Extraction Strategies
- [✅] **JSON-LD Strategy** (`extract/strategies/json_ld.py`) - Structured data extraction working
- [✅] **Table Strategy** (`extract/strategies/directory_table.py`) - HTML table parsing working (used by Fresno)
- [ ] **Cards Strategy** (`extract/strategies/profile_cards.py`) - Card layouts (Phase 1.5)
- [ ] **Search Strategy** (`extract/strategies/search.py`) - Site search (Phase 2+)
- [ ] **Sitemap Strategy** (`extract/strategies/sitemap.py`) - XML sitemaps (Phase 2+)

### Advanced Features (Later Phases)
- [ ] **Pagination** (`extract/pagination.py`) - Multi-page directories
- [ ] **Profile Enrichment** - Fetch individual profile pages
- [ ] **JS Rendering** (`fetch/browser.py`) - Playwright integration
- [ ] **Evaluation Harness** (`scripts/eval_canary.py`) - Success rate tracking

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Fixtures Captured
- [✅] **Fresno State Music Faculty** - 36 faculty members via `directory_table` strategy
  - File: `fixtures/fresno_music_success.html` + `fresno_music_success.expected.json`
  - Test: `test_golden_fixtures.py::test_fresno_music_golden_fixture()` ✅ PASSING
  - Status: 🔒 LOCKED (prevents regressions)

### Golden Tests Status
- [✅] Basic smoke test (canary) - All endpoints responding correctly
- [✅] Schema validation test - Pydantic models working perfectly  
- [✅] Golden fixture test - Fresno State directory extraction locked in
- [✅] Strategy isolation test - `directory_table` strategy working independently

### Canary URL List
*Will create list of 10-15 representative university music faculty directories*

## 🐛 Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues

## 💡 Key Learnings & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Each extraction method is a separate, testable module
- **Feature Flags**: Expensive operations (JS, enrichment) are toggleable
- **Golden Fixtures**: Lock in working examples to prevent regressions
- **Timeboxing**: 45-minute limit per problem to avoid loops

### Technical Decisions
- **Python + FastAPI**: Fast development, good AI assistant support
- **BeautifulSoup**: Robust HTML parsing
- **Pydantic**: Schema validation and type safety
- **Playwright**: JS rendering when needed (behind flag)

**Time Spent**: [X hours]

### Session 2 - 2024-01-15 (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH)
**Goals**: Install dependencies, create basic API structure, set up schemas
**Accomplished**: 
- ✅ Complete FastAPI server with full pipeline working
- ✅ All core extraction strategies implemented (JSON-LD + directory_table)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Phase 0 Targets ✅ COMPLETE
- [✅] `/scrape` endpoint returns stable JSON structure
- [✅] Basic test framework working (`pytest`)  
- [✅] Can handle at least 1 real university URL without crashing
- [✅] Error handling returns proper error envelope

### Phase 1 Core Targets (In Progress)
- [✅] JSON-LD + table strategies working
- [✅] First golden fixture captured (Fresno State - 36 faculty)
- [🔄] Need 2-3 more diverse fixtures  
- [🔄] Email enrichment testing
- [🔄] Success rate evaluation framework

### Testing Approach
1. **Smoke Test**: Does the basic pipeline work end-to-end?
2. **Golden Tests**: Do saved fixtures still work after changes?
3. **Canary Tests**: What's our success rate on representative URLs?
4. **Schema Tests**: Is our output JSON always valid?

### Start Next Session With
1. Install dependencies via `pyproject.toml`
2. Create Pydantic schemas for `NormalizedLead` and `ErrorEnvelope`
3. Build basic `/scrape` endpoint structure
4. Set up pytest configuration
5. Test basic endpoint response structure
